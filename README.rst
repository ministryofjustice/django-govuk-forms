Django GOV.UK Forms
===================

**ðŸš¨ Breaking change: versions 0.8 and above are completely incompatible with 0.1 to 0.7.**

It should be easy to make a Django-based service that follows Government Digital Servicesâ€™ style guide and reference materials.

This Django app allows forms to be output using the HTML that can be styled using GOV.UK design system components.
The styles themselves are provided by another package [1]_.

Note that this library attempts to wrap all fields and widgets available in Django.
The style guide, however, does not provide best-practice patterns for all of these.
You should always consult the `Design System`_ before making choices about form presentation.

NB: Until version 1.0, there is likely going to be a lot of variation in the api,
so itâ€™s a good idea to pin a specific minor version.

Usage
-----

- Install ``django-govuk-forms`` or ``django-govuk-template[forms]``
- Add ``govuk_forms`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``
- Inherit forms from ``govuk_forms.forms.GOVUKForm`` and use widgets from ``govuk_forms.widgets``

See the demo folder in this repository on `GitHub`_, it is not included in distributions.

Development

Please report bugs and open pull requests on `GitHub`_.

Use ``python setup.py test`` to run all tests.

This repository does not need to be updated for every release of GDSâ€™s packages,
only breaking changes for overridden components may need fixes.

If any localisable strings change, run ``python setup.py makemessages compilemessages``.

Distribute a new version to `PyPi`_ by updating the ``VERSION`` tuple in ``govuk_forms``
and run ``python setup.py compilemessages sdist bdist_wheel upload``.

To do
-----

- Add single-question form page view and template
- Fix clearable file input
    - Removing file might not work
    - If initial value exists, label should open replacement conditional
    - Share templates with multi-radio widget
- Allow for error message summaries to be full sentences, e.g. using error codes
- Improve templating and customisation options?
